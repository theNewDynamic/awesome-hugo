# Awesome Hugo  [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re) <img src="hugo-logo-wide.svg" align="right" width="250">

[awesome-hugo.dev](http://awesome-hugo.dev/)

A curated list of awesome things related to Hugo, the world's fastest framework for building websites.

Hugo is a general-purpose website framework—written in Go—that generates static webpages.

> Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast and secure. Hugo sites can be hosted anywhere…and work well with CDNs. Hugo sites run without the need for a database or dependencies on expensive runtimes like Ruby, Python, or PHP. We think of Hugo as the ideal website creation tool with nearly instant build times, able to rebuild whenever a change is made.
